Developed using Python 2.7.3

PURPOSE: 
=======

To build Core Regulatory Circuitry from H3K27ac ChIP-seq data 


1) REQUIREMENTS
----------------

FIMO (Grant et al. 2011) from the MEME suite and SAMtools (http://www.htslib.org/) (Li et al., 2009) must be installed

Code must be run from the directory in which it is stored together with TFlist_NMid_hg.txt, TFlist_NMid_ms.txt, VertebratePWMs.txt, MotifDictionary.txt, bamToGFF.py, utils.py, bamToGFFutils.py and a directory named "annotation" containing the genome annotation files (hg19_refseq.ucsc, hg18_refseq.ucsc, mm9_refseq.ucsc) 

The bam file of sequencing reads for H3K27ac must be sorted and indexed using SAMtools 

Fasta files for the genome used must be placed in a directory that will be specified when runing the program (-f option). Those files must be split by chromosome and termed "chrN.fa" with N being the chromosome number. 
They can be downloaded from http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/chromosomes/ (they will need to be unzipped)


2) CONTENT
-----------

CRCmapper.py: main program

utils.py: utility methods

TFlist_NMid_hg.txt: TFs used and their human NMIDs

TFlist_NMid_ms.txt: TFs used and their murine NMIDs

VertebratePWMs.txt: Vertebrate Motifs PWM library

MotifDictionary.txt: TFs used and their associated motif PWM names

bamToGFF.py: program calculating density of sequencing reads from the bam file in specified regions, and the genome annotation file (https://github.com/bradnerComputation/pipeline/blob/master/bamToGFF.py) (Lin et al. 2012)

annotation/hg19_refseq.ucsc, annotation/hg18_refseq.ucsc and annotation/mm9_refseq.ucsc: genome annotation files

3) USAGE
---------
The program is run by calling CRCmapper.py from the directory containing all the documents:

python CRCmapper.py -e [ENHANCER_FILE] -b [BAM_FILE] -g [GENOME] -f [FASTA] -s [SUBPEAKS]  -x [EXP_CUTOFF] -l [EXTENSION-LENGTH] -n [NAME] -o [OUTPUT_FOLDER][optional: ]


* Required parameters:

-e [ENHANCER_FILE]

[ENHANCER_FILE]: enhancer table (SAMPLE_AllEnhancers.table.txt) generated with ROSE (https://bitbucket.org/young_computation/rose)

-b [BAM_FILE]

[BAM_FILE]: sorted indexed bam file for H3K27ac sequencing reads

-g [GENOME]

[GENOME]: build of the genome to be used for the analysis. Currently supports HG19, HG18 and MM9

-f [FASTA]

[FASTA]: path to the corresponding genome fasta files

-s [SUBPEAKS]

[SUBPEAKS]: bedfile of peaks output from MACS used to identify SE constituents

-x [EXP_CUTOFF]

[EXP_CUTOFF]: percentage of transcripts that are not considered expressed, default=33

-l [EXTENSION-LENGTH]

[EXTENSION-LENGTH]: length (in bp) to extend constituents for motif search, default=500

-n [NAME]

[NAME]: sample name

-o [OUTPUT_FOLDER]

[OUTPUT_FOLDER]: directory to be used for storing output


* Optional parameters:

-a [ACTIVITY_TABLE]

[ACTIVITY_TABLE]: a two column table with refseq in the first column and the associated activity (expression or promoter acetylation level) in the second column

-E [ENHANCER_NUMBER]

[ENHANCER_NUMBER]: the number of top ranked enhancers to include in the analaysis, default = supers
